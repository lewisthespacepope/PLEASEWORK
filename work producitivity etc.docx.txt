10 mental concepts that will make you way smarter:
Effectiveness vs. Efficiency
Effectiveness: Doing the right things—getting the result you intend.
Efficiency: Doing things right—working with minimal waste of time and effort.
To achieve more, you must be both effective & efficient, but effectiveness should come first.

Curse of Knowledge
Once we know something, we assume everyone else knows it, too.
It's why some experts can't explain their field in simple terms and people don't share knowledge that could benefit others.
Lesson: There are always people to teach and people to learn from.

Zero-Sum Heuristic
We judge situations to be zero-sum (person A's gain is person B's loss) when they’re actually non-zero-sum (both parties can gain together).
In most of modern life, the more you help others win, the more you will win.
When possible, play positive-sum games

Systems vs. Goals
To achieve more, focus on the process first—the system—that will get you to the goal.
Doing something every day is a system—like writing for 1 hour.

Fundamental Attribution Error
We underemphasize situational factors and over-emphasize character traits in assessing others.
You haven't slept well so you know why you're slow, they haven't slept well so you assume they're a slow person.

Picard management tip: If you only play to your strengths you may look competent but ultimately you will stagnate. Play to your weaknesses as well. Improve with practice. There is so much more to learn.

Steve Jobs
by Ashlee Vance
15 life-changing lessons, most people take a lifetime to learn: 
1. Without health, you have nothing.


2. It's never too late to start. It's never too late to change. 
3. You can't take care of others if you're unable to take care of yourself.


4. You don't have to prove anything to anybody, including yourself. 
5. The quality of your life is the quality of your relationships. Full stop.


6. The slow accumulation of small, simple experiences ends up being far more valuable than most big, life-changing experiences. 
7. Failures are lessons in disguise.


8. Procrastination turns you into a slave and wastes so much of your precious time. 
9. Kindness costs nothing and is so important.


10. Show gratitude. Gratitude the little things we have, into enough. 
11. Live in the present. The past is gone, and the future isn't a guarantee.


12. Listen more, talk less. 
13. You are a reflection of the 5 people you spend the most time with.


14. Nothing feels as good as something you do from the heart.


 




15. The only person you have to face in the morning is yourself.


If you’re losing your soul, open this: 
This game of life isn’t easy, I myself have been misguided several times in my life, thinking dark thoughts and giving up on life.


Keep playing the game of life…


Here are 12 strategies you can implement from today to lead a fruitful and successful life: 
1. Hit the gym


It will develop the trait of discipline. As your discipline grows in the gym so does your physique, focus, self-belief and confidence.


You lay the foundation for a healthy body for the rest of your life with this simple habit. 
2. Healthy diet


In addition to No.1, healthy food is vital. It’ll protect and prolong your health.


“A healthy man wishes for 1000 things where a sick man only wishes for one”


• No take away
• No processed foods
• No sugar
• More water
• More greens
• More protein 
3. Read daily


The amount of knowledge found in books is frightening. Set a specific slot each day to read for half an hour (I choose before bed). You will level up your focus, writing, memory and communication skills.


Take notes and implement what you have learnt. 
4. Mediate daily


Ten minutes of simple guided meditation a day will aid in:


• Reduced anxiety
• Reduced depression
• Increased mental clarity
• Increased focus
• Better self-awareness
• Increased creativity
• Better stress management
• Focusing on the present 
5. Don’t be afraid to cut toxic people off


It doesn’t matter how long they have been in your life or what their relation is to you. If they do not share the same growth mindset and bring you down, you must leave them behind.


You will find a better circle in this process. 
6. Take risks daily


Don’t be a scared person. Understand that almost all reward comes on the otherwise of fear. If you never take risks you will never progress in life.


“You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take” 
7. Find God


I don’t currently have any religion. I was raised religious for 19 years and never really believed in God.


Now?


Now I understand what believing in God is doing for me in this game of life.


I pray you find the strength to follow the same path. 
8. Find your Pride


Along with God, find your Pride.


These will be growth mindset people on a different course but similar mindset.


These people will align in goals, progress and vision.


The more you tune into these yourself, the easier your tribe is to find. 
9. Self - sufficiency


It’s important to go it alone. Why would anyone accept you into a tribe if you didn’t bring something to the table?


Be a lion. Every single Pride member has a duty to fulfil with support from those around them in times of need. 
10. Adopt a disciplined positive mindset


There isn’t a problem positivity can’t solve.


Read that again and really think about it. 
11. Reset your dopamine receptors


The number one cause for lost souls.


You get so much enjoyment for toxic habits everything else in life feels empty.


- Porn
- Alcohol
- Drugs
- Sugar
- Video Games


Are a few examples of what’s taking your soul. 
12. Travel


Find yourself.


Learn new cultures and languages.


Meet incredible people.


Explore every corner of this planet, you were put here to explore and push your boundaries.


Step into the unknown.


Picard management tip: It takes hard work to become a master at single-tasking.
Can't focus?


Here are 9 science-backed tips to easily maximize your focus:


It's becoming harder to focus on one thing.


But focus is what enables us to do hard things.


Focus is simultaneously becoming more rare AND more valuable.


So if you want to get ahead of 99% of people, use these 9 tips to improve your focus. 
1) Do a brain dump


A big reason you can't focus:


You have too much on your mind.


Grab a pen and paper.


Write down everything on your mind.


Your mind will be clearer - and focusing will be easier. 
2) Don't multitask


You might think you can do two productive things at one time...


But the brain doesn't work that way.


When you're multitasking, your brain switches back and forth between each task.


Each switch costs time and energy, making you less effective and more tired. 
3) Minimize distractions


Distractions can be external:


• loud sounds around you
• too many browser tabs open
• a messy (or uncomfortable) workspace


Try to eliminate (or get away from) those.


Or internal:


• worries
• fears
• ideas


Brain dumping helps with those. 
The last two points are important.


When your attention switches from one thing to another...


It can take 25 MINUTES for your attention to 100% return to what you were first doing.


A distraction doesn't just cost you 30 seconds.


It can cost 25 minutes and 30 seconds. 


 
4) Put your phone out of sight (and out of ear)


One of your biggest distractions is your phone.


Studies have shown your performance is reduced when your phone is in your field of view.


When it's time to focus, silence your phone and put it out of sight. 
5) Plan your work


Another big reason why you can't focus:


You don't know WHAT to focus on.


To fix this...


• Brain dump the things you need to get done
• Pick 3 of them
• Plan times you'll work on them tomorrow


Plan tomorrow's work today to increase tomorrow's focus. 
When you plan out your work blocks, start with the Pomodoro method:


• Work for 25 minutes
• Take a 5 minute break
• Repeat a few more times


As you build your focus "muscle", gradually increase your work time.


75 minutes of work followed by a 15 minute break is a great goal. 
6) Go for a walk


Walks help you focus when you get back to work.


Research has shown walking increases brain activity - especially in areas related to attention and focus.


Going for a quiet walk also gives your subconscious space to chew on your problems and spit out new ideas. 


 
7) Meditate


Meditation is scientifically proven to increase your ability to focus.


It trains your brain to focus on something DESPITE your internal or external distractions.


Meditation can be intimidating to beginners - but guided meditations on YouTube make it easy! 
8) Have a pre-game ritual


Your brain is wired to make associations.


Try making a "pre-game ritual" your brain associates with deep focused work.


Mine:


• put my phones away
• close unneeded tabs
• put on headphones
• set my timer
• start the Interstellar soundtrack 
9) Listen to music


Studies have shown listening to music while working can help you focus.


I suggest instrumental music so the vocals don't distract you.


A few great options:


• Lo-fi
• Trance
• Classical
• The Interstellar soundtrack
• Any other work by Hans Zimmer








Self-care Tip:


YOU NEED TO HAVE A PURPOSE!


Not a wish, not a dream, a purpose! 


“I woke up today to get this done and will not go to bed until I do it.”




Talent doesn’t make a great team.


Alignment does.


3 critical lessons on team success: 
Let's start with a story.


Retired U.S. Army General Stanley McChrystal knows a few things about building teams.


Throughout his career, he created alignment and comradery between disparate — and often antagonistic — branches of the military. 
In a talk on teamwork to Stanford students in 2014, McChrystal cited the failure of the 2004 U.S. “dream team."


A group of world-class basketball players that paired young stars such as LeBron James, Dwayne Wade, and Carmelo Anthony with veterans Tim Duncan and Allen Iverson. 
Believed to be unbeatable, the latest iteration of the "dream team" was ultimately knocked out by Argentina in a huge upset.


They finished with a disappointing bronze medal––but why?


Simple.


The lesser teams that beat them played more like "teams." 
Lesson 1:


Talent alone doesn’t make a great team.


You can have the best players in the world.


Without faith in your team, trust in their abilities, and alignment behind a common goal, you'll never perform up to expectations.


Forget about exceeding them. 
The convergence of these is what McChrystal calls a "shared consciousness."


You might envision this idea as similar to a state of “flow."


The point where you become immersed in a task or project.


Now imagine applying that same flow state to your team dynamic. 
Lesson 2:


You've got to be aligned.


Shared consciousness enables you to read, anticipate, and even nonverbally communicate with your team.


Even when your team isn’t immediately around you, shared consciousness enables you to act as if they are.


You're all on the same page. 
You can anticipate how they will think, approach, and react to challenges.


Goals have been communicated, tasks have been assigned, the plan is in place.


 




Your team is functioning as a single, harmonious unit rowing in sync toward a shared destination. 
Lesson 3:


Without trust you have nothing.


When you are working with people you trust, you all move more quickly because you have confidence in each other.


It’s a relationship of ease and freedom. 
Instead of burning calories looking over your shoulder, you can focus on what’s in front of you.


Think of a time when the opposite was true and you worked with people you didn’t trust.


How much time and effort did you waste just trying to prevent them from messing something up? 
Trust within a team means you don’t have to micromanage each other.


You know your teammates will either achieve success on their own or come to you if they need something.


You can focus on your own objectives, and they will trust you in kind. 
The important idea to understand here is that trust-building is a component of every activity and action.


It’s not something you decide; it’s something you do.


Below are four actionable ideas for increasing mutual trust, the basis for shared consciousness on your team. 
Experience other roles:


McDonald’s requires new corporate hires to flip burgers at a restaurant for their first few weeks on the job.


The idea is this:


How can new hires drive corporate strategy, manage compliance, or market the brand if they’ve never worked in their stores? 
Build cross-functional teams:


Teams that consistently work together, with similar skills and over-lapping tasks, are much more likely to be well coordinated.


Eradicate internal silos by building teams made up of people from different functions wherever possible. 


 
Develop "battle rhythms"


Creating predictable, frequent rhythms allows groups to better synchronize their activities, and in turn, develop a common way of thinking.


Everyone knows when tasks are scheduled to take place and nothing is left to chance. 
Think about your business routines.


Are you falling into these traps?


• Infrequent planning
• Making decisions only when necessary
• Reviewing processes after they are broken


Implementing battle rhythms ensures each process is reviewed on a pre-set schedule. 
Maximize sharing:


To create an environment in which your peers can think like you, they need to know everything relevant that you know.


As you seek to share consciousness, you’ll first need to share information.


Sounds simple, right?


It should be. 
What often doesn’t get shared is how you approach problems and make decisions.


Problem-solving involves a fantastic amount of knowledge.


• What you know
• What data you rely on
• What your assumptions are
• What mental models you apply


Teach your team to think like you. 
Let's recap.


As with many things in life, the plan is simple, but that doesn't mean it's easy.


Building a culture of faith, alignment and trust takes effort––and it takes time.


I hope you'll start now. 
That’s all for today.


1/ I've been managing people remotely for 8 years. Here's how to be a better manager in a remote (distributed) team: 
2/ First off: being a great manager and being a great remote manager are nearly identical.


Most of these tips would directly translate to an office. If you are a good manager in the office, transition shouldn't be hard.


I.e. you don't need to smell people to manage them. 
3/ One-on-one calls:


Have regularly 1:1 calls with all your reports. The point of these calls is to check in with the person, not the work.


What that means in practice is that you don't spend that time reviewing work - you can do that async. 
4/ You spend the 1:1 time coaching, unblocking, helping them grow, providing feedback, discussing plans and doubts, etc.


Feedback first, then strategic, then tactical. Many managers make the mistake of doing this the other direction.


Do 1:1 meetings weekly. 30-60 minutes. 
5/ Reduce length and frequency based on preferences of either party and/or a feeling of needing it less.


Always have an agenda, but keep it light. This is the exception to the rule of running tight meetings. 
6/ You want to have the breathing room to discuss more sensitive and/or personal matters (e.g. job performance). Don't rush those. 
7/ Setting the example:


Work and communicate in public for everything but personal matters. It's super easy to fall back into the habit of DMing people, rather than having discussions in public channels (be those @SlackHQ or your project mngt tool, or @NotionHQ 
8/ This makes you much more accessible, visible, and sets a great example that reinforces async standards. 


 
9/ Document things yourself. Don't delegate minor documentation tasks if you're directly involved. No one is too big to write documentation. 
10/ Regularly check in on workload and working hours of all your reports.


Working remotely makes it much easier to overwork, and not everyone will naturally bring this up or even make it visible.


You have to ask. 
11/ When you find that people are overtired, overworked or just need a break - give them that break.


Take their work/worries away and let them take off. Don't postpone this, do it right away. Rest is essential. 
12/ Limit number of reports:
You should not have many reports. More than 8 is really hard to manage well. Exceptions to this are very experienced people, but everyone needs a coach or someone to help them get unstuck. 
13/ A good manager is available to their team. That means they can make time for everyone. 
14/ If you have more than ~8 reports, split the team up and either add hierarchy or some other structure that makes it so everyone has a manager that has time for them.


Point being: you need to have someone that can help you out. If you are that person, you need time for it. 
15/ Document, document, document. No matter your seniority or rank, you should be documenting.


Document how you work, how you expect to work with others. Make changes to documentation that other people wrote proactively. Be the example. 
16/ Connect individually at a deeper level, i.e. don't neglect to bond emotionally with the people you work with. This will make it more fun, and easier to work together - especially when times are tough. 
17/ Hiring is a huge part of this. Here's a few nuggets on it, will expand in the future: 
18/ Hire great people you can trust. Then once people are onboarded, give them that trust from day one. Always assume good intent. Don't ramp up on this, or wait until you see results. That's a false start for everyone involved. Trust starts day 1. 
19/ To hire great people, focus on shared values.


Don't focus on remote working experience, but look for whether someone can work independently, and is able to communicate effectively. That'll fully determine whether they can do their work remotely. 
20/ Once hired, set expectations. It can be super helpful to create 30/60/90 day plan with targeted goals.


My number 1 hack for productivity:


Anything which can be done under a minute do it then and there. Don’t leave it pending.


If you want to become "mentally tough", read this: 
Building mental strength is fundamental to living your best life.


Just as we go to the gym and lift weights in order to build our physical muscles,


We must also develop our mental health through the use of mental tools and techniques.


And to help you with this... 
 
In this thread, I will be sharing:


A. 5 Ways to Build and Improve Mental Toughness


B. 5 Exercises to create an ‘armored mind’


Let's get into it: 
A.1. Master your emotions:


Our emotions play a big role in how we act or react to negative situations.


It’s therefore important internally to understand and acknowledge your feelings, and how they affect our decisions.


Your dominant thought often dictates the end result! 
2. Set New Goals:


The ability to:


- develop new goals
- develop actionable steps to achieve those goals
- and to execute on those goals


Help to develop willpower and mental resilience. 
3. Small wins make for big gains:


Simple wins in life make us feel good and through feeling better we become mentally stronger.


Set yourself small targets that you can easily tick off,


The goal here is to set yourself up for success, not failure. 
4. Focus on making yourself happy:


You feel mentally stronger if you are happy.


The fear of disappointing others may hold you back,


So you need to avoid making compromises to please others at the expense of following your dream. 
5. Forget about your past:


Energy is powerful, so focus on what makes you productive.


Dwelling on your past failure or success may deter you from achieving your goals.


 




Whether you have had a good or bad past, you need to put it behind you and focus on your new target. 
B. 5 challenges will help you sharpen your mind and create an ‘armored mind’.


Note: These challenges are inspired from the book "Can't Hurt Me" by David Goggins.


I have sorted them from the easiest to hardest: 
 
Challenge #1:


Create Your Identity with the Accountability Mirror.


What is it?


The Accountability Mirror method is when you put post-it notes with your goals on your mirror so you see them every morning.


 Write this out and don't use a digital device for this practice. 
Why this method?


This practice is all about self-improvement and self-discipline.


It’s about being honest with yourself and checking in with yourself and your goals every day.


You will hold yourself accountable to the standard you want for your life. 
Challenge #2:


Write Down the Things that Make You Uncomfortable.


The idea here is to come face to face with your fears.


I'm not talking about staring down the barrel of a gun


I'm talking about the things you know could be good for you if you were willing to try them. 
Why this method?


Doing things - even small things - that make you uncomfortable will help you get strong.


When you get strong, mentally and physically it’s hard for people to get under your skin.


You become resilient. 
Challenge #3:


Break Your Goal Down into Small Tasks:


Simply break your big goals (sometimes called the BHAG or big hairy audacious goal) into smaller, more attainable goals. 


 
Why this method?


Breaking your goal into small tasks helps you feel satisfied when you complete them,


It helps you build a system for daily success and helps you build momentum. 
Challenge #4:


Visualize Your Goal:


The average person thinks 2000-3000 thoughts per hour.


Rather than focusing on bullshit, you cannot change, imagine visualizing the things you can. 
Why this method?


A visualization is a powerful tool for turning your ideas into reality.


Visualizing helps to activate your subconscious mind and programs your brain to achieve your goals. 
Challenge #5:


Taking Souls.


What is it?


Choose any competitive situation you’re in right now and do whatever it takes to be EXCELLENT.


The idea is to dominate by working harder than anyone could ever expect of you. 
Why this method?


This forces you to push yourself harder than ever before for your personal glory of knowing you’ve achieved excellence.


This is an advanced tactic for those of you willing to push yourself to the brink. 
Conclusion:


Building mental strength is fundamental to living your best life.


In order to be mentally healthy, we must build up our mental strength!


It is something that is developed over time by individuals who choose to make personal development a priority. 
If you want to develop into the best version of yourself






42 Rules for Life: 
1. Tell the truth… or, at least, don’t lie.


Truth reduces the terrible complexity of a man to the simplicity of his word. Truth is the ultimate, inexhaustible natural resource. It’s the light in the darkness. 
2. Do not do things that you hate.


Watch yourself. If you see that you’re doing things that make you hate yourself, consider the cost of continuing. 
3. Act so that you can tell the truth about how you act.


Stop doing things that you know are wrong, that you could stop doing. It might be a little thing. That’s fine. Stop doing it, and see what happens. You strengthen yourself. 
4. Pursue what is meaningful, not what is expedient.


There is no faith, no courage, and no sacrifice in doing what is expedient. To have meaning in your life is better than to have what you want because you may neither know what you want, nor what you truly need. 
5. If you have to choose, be the one who does things instead of the one who is seen to do things.


If you fulfill your obligations every day, you don't need to worry about the future. 
6. Pay attention.


What do you do if your life isn’t in order? Pay attention. Paying attention is like watching for something you don’t know. It’s an unbelievably powerful force. 
7. Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you need to know.


You want to enter into a conversation so that you come out wiser than you went in. 
8. Listen to them hard enough so that they will share it with you.


The sympathetic responses during a genuine conversation indicate that the teller is valued and that the story being told is important, serious, deserving of consideration, and understandable. 
9. Plan and work diligently to maintain the romance in your relationship.


Allow yourself to become aware of what you want and need, and have the decency to let your partner in on the secret. Do not expect the beauty of love to maintain itself without all-out effort on your part. 
10. Be careful who you share good news with.


You want to share good news with people who will be genuinely happy for you. That’s one way you can identify those people who are on your side. 
11. Be careful who you share bad news with.


You can tell a true friend bad news, and they’ll listen. They won’t derail the whole conversation about how something worse happened to them once. 
12. Make at least one thing better every single place you go.


I’m on the side of the person that wants to do something positive with their life. Start by maximizing the quality of your life. Figure out how to do that in a way that’s of benefit to your relatives and community. 
13. Imagine who you could be, and then aim single-mindedly at that.


Aim at something profound, noble and lofty. Pick the best target you can conceptualize. Stumble toward it. Notice your errors and misconceptions along the way, and correct them. Confront what stands in your way. 
14. Do not allow yourself to become arrogant or resentful.


If you’re resentful, you’re likely not standing up for yourself sufficiently, or someone is legitimately treading on your territory. You need to do something about that. Or live with the consequences. 
15. Try to make one room in your house as beautiful as possible.


The world presents itself as a series of puzzles. Some of which you’re capable of solving and some of which you’re not.


 




If you want to change the world, you start with yourself and work outward. 
16. Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today.


The people you compare yourself to you don't know very well. You see a shiny outside but not the reality of their life. Be less concerned with other people's actions. You have plenty to do yourself 
17. Work as hard as you possibly can on at least one thing and see what happens.


You will change. You will start to become one thing, instead of the clamoring multitude you once were. It is far better to become something than to remain anything but become nothing. 
18. If old memories still make you cry, write them down carefully and completely.


If you're obsessed with memories of the past (most of them negative), there's a lot of you stuck in the past. Many people have parts of them that are stuck in some traumatic childhood experience. 
19. Maintain your connections with people.


There is no evidence that the importance of friendship declines in any manner with age. 
20. Do not carelessly denigrate social institutions or artistic achievement.


“We don’t need to get married. We don’t need a piece of paper.” That’s the depth of thought you put into it? You’re not going to mark the occasion with conscious awareness and social celebration? 
21. Treat yourself as if you were someone that you are responsible for helping.


You have a vital role to play in the unfolding destiny of the world. You should take care of, help, and be good to yourself the same way you take care of, help, and be good to someone you love. 
22. Ask someone to do you a small favor so that he or she can ask you to do one in the future.


You don't obsessively keep track of who owes what, when, and why. That's a sign of a degenerating relationship. You do what you can for them, and they do what they can for you. 
23. Make friends with people who want the best for you.


You have an ethical responsibility to surround yourself with people who have the courage and faith, and wisdom to wish you well when you've done something good. And to stop you when you're doing something destructive. 
24. Do not try to rescue someone who does not want to be rescued.


It's a very dangerous activity, and it can easily be counterproductive. The probability that they're going to take you down, compared to you elevating them, is very, very high. 
25. And be very careful about rescuing someone who does. 
26. Nothing well done is insignificant. 
27. Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world.


The world is harsh. Should you criticize it? Not until you put yourself together. You have to bring everything you can to bear on your problems before you have any right to stand in judgment about Being itself. 
28. Dress like the person you want to be. 
29. Be precise in your speech.


Let's say that you're having a rough patch in your relationship and you don't know why. The issue is unnameable. Is it real? Well, yes, it's manifesting itself in a physiological discomfort. 
...Then you talk about it, name it, and it goes from this blurry thing into a little monster. It's this precision that enables you to specify it.


Now you can do something about it (it's little, at least) if you can admit to it. 
30. Stand up straight with your shoulders back.


To stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the terrible responsibility of life with eyes wide open. It means deciding to voluntarily transform the chaos of potential into the realities of habitable order. 
31. Don’t avoid something frightening if it stands in your way–and don’t do unnecessarily dangerous things.


The gradual exposure to what you’re afraid of is curative. Confront the world forthrightly and expose yourself courageously to things you’re afraid of. Life will improve. 
32. Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them. 
33. Do not transform your wife into a maid. 
34. Do not hide unwanted things in the fog.


There will be times in your life when it will take everything you have to face what is in front of you, instead of hiding away from a truth so terrible that the only thing worse is the falsehood you long to replace it with. 
35. Notice that opportunity lurks where responsibility has been abdicated.


You positively need to be occupied with something weighty, deep, profound, and difficult.


What would your life be like if you made use of all the potential that you were offered? 
36. Read something written by someone great.


Carl Jung had an idea that part of personality development is to understand your shadow, the parts of you that you don't want to admit to. You can learn about your shadow by reading history.


A book isn't paper; it's a portal. 
37. Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street.


​​When things are not good and hard, you get these little moments where a little bit of possibility still shines through.


You’ve got to take those moments when you get them. 
38. Do not bother children when they are skateboarding.


They jump in the air, grab their skateboard, balance on the rail, and slide for 20 feet.


Children are practicing being courageous. They're practicing mastering something in the face of danger. 
39. Don’t let bullies get away with it.


I usually use a rule of three:


If we interact and you do something that I find disruptive, I'll note it.


If you do it again, I think, "That probably wasn't merely a situation." I'll leave it be because that's still not enough evidence. 
...If you do it a third time, then I'll say, "Hey, I just noticed this. Not only did it happen, but it happened here. And it happened here. So there's something going on here. I'm not ignoring it." 
40. Write a letter to the government if you see something that needs fixing–and propose a solution. 
41. Remember that what you do not yet know is more important than what you already know.


It is much better to make friends with what you do not know than with what you do know, as there is an infinite supply of the former but a finite stock of the latter. 
42. Be grateful in spite of your suffering.
There’s some real utility in gratitude. Gratitude is the process of consciously and courageously attempting thankfulness in the face of the catastrophe of life.

6 tips every man should be doing to maximize their testosterone and recovery.


--Thread-- 
Many people are using the phrase ‘self-care’ these days.


It’s popular amongst women. A day at the spa, a brunch with the girls etc…


We don’t hear the term ‘masculine self-care’ nearly as often. 
However, it’s more important than ever for men to take care of their mind and their bodies. 


Masculinity is facing a crisis. Many men struggle with unspoken mental health issues. They neglect their bodies and appearance.


The good news?


You can turn this around in 24 hours. 
That’s where the ‘6S’ program comes in.


This is a series of 6 steps for men over a course of 24 hours to reset your mind and body.


Ready to take back control? Let’s jump in. 
1. Sports


Sports have an immense effect on our mental health, as well as our physical health.


You could:


Play sports, hit the gym, go for a hike.


Just make sure you do an intense period of exercise. 


Get the blood flowing to your brain. Get your testosterone levels pumping. 
2. Sunlight


We spend more time indoors than ever now. So many people are Vitamin-D deficient.


Make sure you spend time outdoors today. 


Expose multiple parts of your body to direct sunlight to maximize Vit-D exposure.


Also, sun your sack. Trust me. 


 
3. Swedish massage


Get a massage. You’ll thank me later.


Get rid of any stigma that they’re only for women.


Go for 90 minutes to ensure your muscles are fully relaxed and lymphs fully drained.


If you’re already quite active, consider a deep tissue massage instead. 
4. Sauna


Saunas possess immense health benefits:


- Sweats out toxins
- Reduced stress levels
- Better blood circulation
- Improved immune function


Normally, toxins and estrogens build up in your fat cells, where they become hard to remove.


15 minutes in the sauna can help. 
5. Steak


Grass-fed. Free of antibiotics. Good, old-fashioned steak.


It’s full of protein and iron, which are essential to help build muscle and improve brain function. 
Pair steak with a cruciferous vegetable (broccoli, cabbage) and a fermented food (sauerkraut, kimchi) for maximum nutritional reset. 
6. Sleep


Arguably, the most important step.


To finish this day:


- Sleep in a pitch black room
- Keep all electronic devices outside
- Disable WiFi if it is near to your room


And, most importantly…


Don't set an alarm.


Let your body fully recover for the next day. 
This 6S guide takes 24 hours.


If you follow the 6 steps, you will feel like a renewed man the day after
How to become disciplined


A thread that will make you a dangerous force of nature: 
Discipline beats talent.


You need to stop relying on sole motivation if you want to succeed.


Here is how you become dangerous...


... In 7 steps ↓ 
1/ PURPOSE


Define your 'why'. It will give you something to fall back on, should you need it. Because a man with a cause is far more eager to succeed than a man without.


Think of your purpose as your personal insurance. 
How to find purpose:


- Focus on what you're good at
- Focus on how you can help others
- Focus on defining your desired legacy


From there, you can get to work. 
I have actually written an entire e-book on finding purpose, which is FREE to download.


It includes 8 ways to find meaning.


Check it out here:


http://p2p.crd.co
2/ PLAN


A goal without a plan isn’t a goal, it’s a dream.


You need to know HOW you are going to achieve the things that you want.


Set the outlines. You will have an easy time achieving your dreams. 


 
How to plan:


- Make a list of weekly priorities
- Convert them into daily tasks (be realistic)
- Knock them out one by one
- Plan necessary brakes (go outside at least every 2 hrs)


Can't go wrong if you do this. 
3/ BUILD HABITS


Your motivation is too inconsistent to rely on. Working on your dreams should be a default action. Not something you have to think about.


Build systems that will make you achieve your dreams automatically.


This is how you win. 
How to build habits:


- Start small
- Increase small
- As you build, break habits into chunks
- Never miss twice
- Be patient (stick to a sustainable pace) 
4/ PASSION


Do everything you do with passion. Even if you don't feel like it. This way you will fulfill even the most daunting tasks.


This is about a mindset shift. Don't expect to think of everything in life as fun, because it isn't.


But some things are just necessary. 
How to be passionate about anything:


- Focus on just the day ahead
- Focus on just the one task
- Step away if you need to 
5/ LIMIT DISTRACTIONS


How do you expect to stay the course when you are constantly distracted by different paths?


You need to limit outside influences and protect your focus, energy, and mental well-being.


Become laser-focused. 
How to limit distractions:


- Lock yourself in a room
- Use noise-canceling headphones (with or without sounds)
- Turn your phone OFF
- Only have max. 2 tabs open at the same time
- Work with a focus timer
- Move every 30 mins minimum 
6/ REFLECT


It is crucial to learn from your mistakes if you want to improve. No improvement will be made if you are not correcting where you went wrong the first time.


Use your time away from your plan to reflect on it. 


 
How to reflect:


- Make it a habit
- Write down your challenges of the day
- Meditate
- Go for walks
- Talk to your friends or spouse 
7/ IMPLEMENT


No use in reflecting on your plan, if you are not going to implement your reflections.


This is the most important step, as it will ensure you continuously improve.


Improvement = meaning = happiness. 
How to implement:


- Assess the possible impact of the change
- Make minor tweaks
- Build upon habits
- Seek feedback
- Be honest with yourself






How to consistently think critically and avoid logical fallacies: 
The following mental models are philosophical razors.


These are rules of thumb that help eliminate unlikely explanations for a phenomenon.


It's not right 100% of the time, but it is more often than not.


It's therefore a useful mental shortcut to make decisions quicker. 
Sagan Standard


Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.


If someone claims that their name is Bob, that's not an extraordinary claim.


If someone claims that they saw a UFO, that is extraordinary, and must be backed up by extraordinary evidence to prove it. 
Hume’s Razor


Causes must be sufficiently able to produce the effect assigned to them.


A fallen power line isn’t enough to cause a national blackout.


If a cause isn’t able to produce the observed effect, we must eliminate it or show what needs to be added to create the effect. 
Popper’s Falsifiability Principle


For a theory to be considered scientific, it must be possible to disprove or refute it.


Example: "All swans are white."


If you find one black swan, you would falsify this theory.


Claims that are unfalsifiable should usually be dismissed . 
Grice’s Razor


Address what the speaker actually meant, instead of addressing the literal meaning of what they actually said.


Don’t take everything someone says literally and get into silly arguments over semantics or minor details, whilst completely missing the main point. 
Duck Test


If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.


If something seems a certain way, it probably is that way.


 




Appearances can deceive, but there's generally no need to deny reality.


Usually, what you see is what you get. 
Tarzwell's Razor


High emotion leads to high bias.


Both science and the justice system hold that dispassion is at the core of their intentions.


”Where there is passion the truth cannot be trusted.”
—James Tarzwell 
That's 6 important philosophical razor's to think critically and avoid falling for logical fallacies.

13 harsh truths that will set you on a better path than a 4-year degree: 
1) Nobody gives a fuck about you.


All of those Facebook birthday wishes on your page were so they could feel good about saying happy birthday.


There are 3-5 people in your life that truly care about your well-being. Give your limited energy to them. 
2) College won't secure your future.


99% of people go to college because it is in someone else's best interest.


If what you want to do requires a college degree, go to college.


The problem is that most don't know what they want. They haven't experienced enough to know. 
If you are lazy and have no ambition, go to college. It will expose you to new opportunities, learning paths, and people that will get you off your ass.


In all other cases it is an immature decision.


Go to a trade school, learn to code / cybersecurity, or take a bet on yourself 
3) There's no such thing as risk.


Risk is a manmade concept. Common sense is a better metric.


You can take the small risk of pushing your limits every day, or take the tremendous risk of playing it safe. 
4) You are the cause of your discontent.


Whether it be diet, lifestyle, mental, or financial choices — you dug yourself into this hole.


Worrying about it more won't do you any good.


The only thing you can do is make a plan, act with intention, and let better choices compound. 
5) Suffering is encoded in the system.


Pain, discomfort, uncertainty, and difficulty are natural parts of life.


They are not inherently negative. They are only negative because you perceive them that way.


 




Stop expecting things to be different than what they are supposed to be. 
6) All you have is your attention.


At the root of all things, your attention is what you are in control of from moment to moment.


Is it being stolen from you? Are you okay with that?


Or are you channeling it towards something that brings growth, meaning, and happiness? 
7) Money won't solve your internal problems.


External? Sure. It can remove stress from most situations.


But your peace, happiness, and contentment with life is accomplished through inner work. 
8) Suppressing your feelings makes them worse.


The only way to learn the most about what you are feeling is to embrace it.


Feel it out fully. Gain a deeper awareness of why you are feeling that way. Let the awareness dissolve any pain associated with it. 
9) Most people chase other's versions of success.


When you pursue an external hierarchy of goals set by society, online communities, or what is praised in the media — the only option is disappointment.


Snap out of it, do what YOU want, and pivot according to feedback. 
10) You can control nothing except for your choices in this moment.


The past? Accept it.


The future? Plan for it.


99% of your attention should be channeled towards maximizing this very moment through intentional choices. 
11) Discomfort is the only way to grow.


The reason you are stuck in this phase of life is because you haven't learned the lesson it is trying to teach you.


Avoiding discomfort for a life that has been laid out for you let's others slowly put nails in your coffin. 
12) People will despise you.


When you break out of the sheepish herd, people will feel threatened. They will project their internal state on you.


When you start to develop yourself, don't take things personally.


Offer a hand. If they don't take it, use that hand to climb. 
13) Money is not evil.


Money is a piece of paper. Thinking it is evil should be a reason to question yourself.


Money is *usually* a reflection of the amount of value produced.


Money is a tool that individuals use to enhance their current state of good or evil.

I’ve coached 83 business owners.


Here are the 5 habits that have impacted their profits the most: 
Habit #1: Setting goals


Setting goals is the first step to achieving anything worthwhile.


Why?


Think back to the last time you took a vacation.


(a "holiday" for my friends across the pond)


Did you hop in your car and drive in a random direction?


No. 
You chose where you wanted to go.


You were then able to figure out how to get there.


Going through life without goals is like driving around without a destination.


Sure, it's fun to go for an aimless late-night drive and blast some Nine Inch Nails or Taylor Swift... 
...but you probably won't end up anywhere meaningful.


Figuring out WHAT you want to achieve in life helps you figure out how to ACHIEVE what you want.


How do you start figuring out what you want?


By asking yourself questions.


Use a pen and paper for this. 
Questions to ask yourself about business goals:


• what's my target monthly revenue?
• what products and/or services do I want to sell?
• what kind of online presence (if any) do I want to have?
• what specific people/groups/businesses are my dream clients/customers/partners? 
As you take action toward your goals, your goals may change.


You may start down a path only to realize it's not for you.


It's okay. It happens.


I thought I wanted to be a software engineer.


I went to college for 6 years only to start my career and realize it wasn't for me. 
Always be:


• moving toward a goal
• aware your goals may change
• willing to change directions instead of continuing down a path that isn't right for you


Just because you put a lot of time/energy/work into something doesn't mean you can't switch to something else. 
Habit #2: Being Organized


If you're like most people, you're drowning in a sea of to-dos.


You're not thriving because you're always focused on surviving.


You can't play offense because you're always playing defense.


Okay, enough with the metaphors... 
You probably wake up stressed and go to bed stressed.


You can't focus when you try to work.


You can't relax when you try to rest.


Why?


Because you aren't organized (yet).


You're trying to keep track of everything in your head. 
Our brains aren't great at doing that effectively.


So to get organized, get things out of your head.


First, do a brain dump.


Write down everything on your mind.


Organize those things into categories (like business, personal, and other). 
Next, pick out 2 to 5 priorities from the things you wrote.


Write them on a separate piece of paper.


This is your "short list" of priorities.


We'll come back to that in a minute.


Here's a more in-depth guide to brain dumping and why it's so effective:

Habit #3: Managing Time and Focus


Time and focus are the most valuable resources in the universe.


Being intentional about how you invest them will lead to better returns on them.


The amount of money you make is entirely determined by what you spend your time and focus on. 
You can waste your time/focus arguing with people on Twitter about the virtues of pineapple on pizza...


...and don't get me wrong, that's a good cause...


But unfortunately, you're not going to make progress in business by doing that when you should be working on business tasks. 
So how do you manage time and focus?


Create time blocks on your calendar to focus on your list of priorities.


If you feel like your focus "muscle" is weak, start with blocks of 30 minutes.


As your focus gets stronger, you can expand those blocks to 45, 60, and 90 minutes. 
You know how you get to the end of a long day and realize you haven't done anything worthwhile?


That's because you didn't manage your time or your focus well enough.

Time management isn't only about the time you work.


It's helpful to create a "baseline schedule" for your entire day.


Here's how you can structure your days in less than 5 minutes:


Unroll available on Thread Reader


Habit #4: Meditating


One of the best ways to get more done each day:


Do nothing for a few minutes each day.


Wait... how does that work? 
Daily meditation causes physical changes to your brain.


The part of your brain involved in your "fight or flight" stress response shrinks.


The part of your brain involved in attention, impulse control, and long-term planning gets thicker.


What's that mean in English? 
You're better at focusing, planning, and getting things done.


You're less likely to struggle with impulsivity, stress, and procrastination.


My clients who have stuck with some form of meditative practice have noticed significant performance boosts.


But how do you start? 
The simplest method is:


• sit down somewhere quiet (or use earplugs/headphones)
• set a timer for 2 to 15 minutes
• close your eyes
• start breathing slowly through your nose
• focus on the feeling of your breath passing through your nose
• do this until the timer goes off 
It's okay if this is uncomfortable at first.


It is for most people.


It'll get easier as you practice.


It'll also cause noticeable benefits throughout your day.


To help get you started, you can try guided meditations on YouTube or apps like Headspace. 
Habit #5: Sleeping well


Sleep has almost always been the first thing I've worked on with new clients.


People typically need 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night.


Most people aren't consistently getting that.


Why? 
Because as I mentioned earlier...


Many people can't relax (or sleep) due to all the noise in their head.


If you can't sleep well at night, you can't work well during the day.


The hustlers are wrong when they say "sleep is for the weak".


The grind sleeps... or the grind stops. 
Sleep deprivation causes a long list of short-term and long-term problems, including...


∙ brain fog
∙ irritability
∙ mood swings
∙ low motivation
∙ difficulty learning
∙ poor impulse control
∙ sadness and depression 
When I started working with @IAmAaronWill (one of my first clients), he had a problem:


His sleep schedule was way off track.


He wasn't awake when prospects were able to get on a call with him.


After we fixed his sleep, he had more calls, got more clients, and made more money. 
I've seen a similar trend with the other clients I've worked with.


We fix the problems hurting their sleep.


They start making lots more money.

So in summary...


The 5 habits that will impact your income the most:


1) Setting goals
2) Being organized
3) Managing time
4) Meditating
5) Sleeping well








The 8 Unusual Traits Of All Productive People: 
I used to think “productivity traits” changed person to person


That you would have different traits that made you productive than me


But no, it turns out, all productive people have these same 8, unusual traits; 
1. They Prioritise Priorities


Productive people know what matters


Productive people know what moves the needle


And they make them their priorities.


Productive people never say “I don’t have time” because they know everyone has time for what they prioritise. 
2. They Don’t Let Their Emotions Control Their Work


Productive people work like professionals, even if they’re not.


Productive people don’t work like amateurs. 
A professional does the work, day in, day out, whether they feel like it or not.


An amateur lets their emotions dictate their work.


But you’ll never get any work done if you let your emotions control your work. 
3. They’re Stoic


Productive people realise they can only control 3 things;


1. their thoughts
2. their words
3. their actions


Everything else is outside of their control, and yours.


When you begin to focus on what you can control, you waste less time on what you can’t. 


 
4. They Have Laser Focus


Productive people aren’t checking their phones every 2 minutes


In fact, they don’t even have their phone in sight when working. 
Productive people guard their energy and focus with everything they have because they understand that it’s the highest ROI skill of the 21st century.


Focus is a skill, start building it. 
5. They’re Life-Long Students


Productive people realise they don’t know everything


They realise there’s always a better way, a better technique, a better method. 
They realise there’s always something they can learn about everything.


As such they’re always learning, through books, courses, YouTube videos, mentors, and most importantly, through experience. 
6. They’re Adaptable


Productive people understand that life happens


Shit happens.


Life gets in the way and often you can’t do exactly what you wanted to do when you wanted to do it. 
They’re able and willing to adapt on a seconds notice.


After all, those who adapt, survive. 
7. They’re Self-Aware


Productive people are aware of their mind and body


They’re able to tell when something is wrong or when something is great


They’re able to tell when to push and when to pull back. 
They’re able to tell when they should do their creative work and when they should do their logistical work.


Productive people are consciously living life. 
8. They’re Selfish


Productive people put themselves first.


Productive people realise that to be selfless you need to be selfish,


Productive people put themselves, their purpose, their goals, and their tasks ahead of everything else. 
They tell people “No” more than most could comfortably think of.


Productive people know, that after all, you can’t pour from an empty cup




Forget willpower. What you need are systems.


9 proven ways to sustain productivity and crush your goals: 
The two biggest crises of the 21st Century are called distractions and choice overload.


But you're not powerless against them.


You see, the right resources and mental models will help you work smarter, not harder.


Here are 9 that will change the way you work and focus: 
1. Distribute the cognitive load


The human brain repels effort.


When something seems like hard work, the mind looks for shortcuts.


But if it can't find them— procrastination follows.


 




A useful aid for thinking clearly & reducing exertion is whiteboarding.


My favorite tool... 
ClickUp


Whiteboards are efficient tools to create mind maps— a science-backed technique that enhances problem-solving.


The best part...


@clickup lets you create tasks directly from your whiteboards.


Going from idea to execution is a breeze.

@mentions
2. Minimize regret


Jeff Bezos centers decisions on one vital question:


At the end of my life, will I regret not having done this?


If the answer is No, it's not worth it.


If the answer is Yes, he goes all in.


This mental model forces you to apply second-order thinking. 
@mentions
By projecting yourself in the future, the amplifying lens of consequences helps to shape a different perspective.


Like in the movie Sliding Doors, these overlapping parallel scenarios conceive a deeper sense of purpose.


And a powerful Why keeps you on the road to success. 
@mentions
3. Apply Newton's Law


An object in motion stays in motion; an object at rest stays at rest.


The same principle relates to creativity.


An active mind stays active: an idle mind stays idle.


One of the distinct traits of our operating system is how malleable it is. 
@mentions
Every time the brain processes new information— neurons fire, and new pathways form.


This is called neuroplasticity.


Simply put, you can optimize performance by rewiring your brain with the right inputs.


Always be learning... 


 
@mentions
4. Establish conceptual milestones


Open loops work wonders in copywriting, but when it comes to tasks— they hamper efficiency.


Human beings are not designed for multitasking. It's a myth.


According to Harvard Business Review...


Multitaskers do less and perform worse. 
@mentions
It takes the brain approx. 15 minutes to re-orient from one chore to another.


Truth is...


Cognitive deviation:


• blocks flow
• hinders creative thinking
• reduces short-term memory


Without focus, there's no learning.


Stick to 1 task— efficiency will increase up to 40%. 
@mentions
5. Assess diminishing returns


The law of diminishing returns is a theory in economics that predicts that when you reach your optimal level, adding another factor will result in smaller increases.


When the effort doesn't match the output— it's time to take a break. 
@mentions
6. Control de peripherals


Creativity thrives without rules & limits...


Wrong.


Constraints rather than freedom yield inventiveness & help overcome functional fixedness.


Let me explain...


The brain is programmed with millions of schemas added over time from life experiences. 
@mentions
A schema is a set of preconceived ideas that shape how you perceive and interpret new information.


The problem is they're static.


Once they're formed is hard to change them.


Why?


The confirmation bias and the mere exposure effect affect rational thinking and accuracy. 
@mentions
That's why adding boundaries to your tasks fosters out-of-the-box thinking.


When you have less to work with, your focus narrows.


You learn to see the world differently.


If you think about it, almost all inventions are born out of necessity. 
@mentions
7. Develop skills/challenges balance


In sports, "the zone" is a mental state of total focus which leads to optimal performance.


Athletes forget about outcomes and act without fear of what might happen— they just react with skillful reflexes.


But how do they get in the zone? 
@mentions
There are some psychological predictors to help you reach this frame of consciousness...


Whether completing a task or making an important decision, one of them is balancing challenge & skill level.


 




The sweet spot is where success neither comes easily nor seems out of reach. 
@mentions
8. Practice inversion


Inversion is a technique for identifying roadblocks and flaws in your thinking.


It's basically reverse-thinking.


The process goes like this: list out all possible ways that might prevent you from achieving your goal, then do everything to avoid them. 
@mentions
9. Keep a positive-sum circle


positive + positive = positive


Applies to math and life.


The people you spend time with shape who you are.


Proximity is power.


Your circle affects your attitudes and behaviors.


To work and think like the best, surround yourself with the best. 
@mentions
Productivity is key to living a better life.


But in that quest, most overexert themselves.


Then frustration comes when there's no steady pattern of improvement in sight.


But systems are about consistency.


Small steps lead to big outcomes. 
@mentions
TL;DR


1. Distribute the cognitive load
2. Minimize regret
3. Apply Newton's Law
4. Establish conceptual milestones
5. Assess diminishing returns
6. Control the peripherals
7. Develop skills/challenges balance
8. Practice inversion
9. Keep a positive-sum circle
8 Powerful Lessons From the Book "Deep Work"


Thread


1. "Who you are, what you think, feel, and do, what you love—is the sum of what you focus on." 
2. "The advantage of cultivating concentration so intense is that there is no attention left over to think about anything irrelevant, or to worry about problems." 
3. "Human beings, it seems, are at their best when immersed deeply in something challenging.


The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile." 
4. "To learn, in other words, is an act of deep work. If you’re comfortable going deep,


you’ll be comfortable mastering the increasingly complex systems and skills needed to thrive." 
5. "Decades of work from multiple different subfields within psychology all point toward the conclusion that regularly resting your brain improves the quality of your deep work." 


 
6. "Separate your pursuit of serendipitous encounters from your efforts to think deeply and build on these inspirations.


You should try to optimize each effort separately, as opposed to mixing them together into a sludge that impedes both goals." 
7. "Spending time in nature can improve your ability to concentrate.


This resource is finite: If you exhaust it, you’ll struggle to concentrate." 
8. "By supporting deep work with rock-solid routines that make sure a little bit gets done on a regular basis,


the rhythmic scheduler will often log a larger total number of deep hours per year."


These 5 traits are holding your team back at work.


THREAD: How to identify and solve the 5 dysfunctions of a team: 
Background: Patrick Lencioni is a pioneer of the organizational health movement.


He has written 11 books and sold over 6 million copies.


One of his most famous books being: "The Five Dysfunctions of a Team"


Here's what you need to know:


The 5 dysfunctions of a team are stacked in a hierarchical pyramid (from bottom to top):


(1) Absence of Trust
(2) Fear of Conflict
(3) Lack of Commitment
(4) Avoidance of Accountability
(5) Inattention to Results


Building a strong foundation at the bottom of the pyramid is crucial to supporting the higher-level traits.


So that's where we'll start and work our way up the pyramid 
 
(1) Absence of Trust:


It's hard to do anything productive if your team doesn't trust each other.


Signs that your team lacks trust:


 Don't ask for help


 Reluctant to be vulnerable


 Unwilling to admit mistakes


 Jump to conclusions about the intentions of others


How to fix Absence of Trust:


 Be the first to own up to a mistake


 Admit your own weaknesses and limitations


 Set a good example by asking your team members for help


 Help team members focus on strengths instead of weaknesses 


 
(2) Fear of Conflict:


Your team may trust each other, but do they embrace conflict?


Signs that your team is afraid of conflict:


 Ignore controversial topics


 Hesitate to voice opinions and concerns


 Worry more about office politics and personal risk management


How to fix Fear of Conflict:


 Praise healthy examples of conflict


 Define what healthy conflict looks like


 Assign a "devil's advocate" in meetings


 Give corrective feedback if conflict veers toward unhealthy 
(3) Lack of Commitment:


If everyone doesn't buy-in, your team will be out of sync.


Signs that your team lacks commitment:


 Fear of failure


 Lack confidence


 Environment of ambiguity & confusion


 Spend too much time making decisions


How to fix Lack of Commitment:


 Define clear deadlines


 Review key decisions at the end of meetings


 Have a contingency plan. This forces your team to face potential pitfalls and fear of failure head-on. 
(4) Avoidance of Accountability:


Lack of accountability is a recipe for mediocrity.


Signs that your team avoids accountability:


 Missed deadlines


 Hesitate to call out peers on counterproductive behaviors


 View corrective feedback as a personal attack


How to fix Avoidance of Accountability:


 Encourage peer feedback


 Hold regular progress reviews


 Set clear standards for performance


 Reward team achievements (rather than individuals) 
(5) Inattention to Results:


You can't have a high-performing team without the results to match.


Signs that your team has an inattention to results:


 Distracted from collective goals easily


 Too much concern over the pursuit of individual goals and status


How to fix Inattention to Results:


 Clear team metrics to assess results


 Give rewards when team goals are met (e.g. extra day off, bonuses, etc.)


If the team already knows how to keep each other accountable, they will push each other toward pursuing common goals. 
Now that you know the 5 dysfunctions of a team, here are 5 questions to ask yourself to get started:


(1) Do your team members openly and readily disclose their opinions?


(2) Are your team meetings compelling and productive? 
(3) Does your team come to decisions quickly and avoid getting bogged down by consensus?


(4) Do your team members confront one another about their shortcomings?


 




(5) Do your team members sacrifice their interests for the good of the team? 
If you answered "yes" to all five questions, you must be doing a pretty good job!


If you hesitated or answered "no" to any of these questions, you have some work to do.


Consider having your team take the full assessment online. (It was beneficial in my experience!)

7 Unique Ways To Get More Done:
The productivity and performance space has a lot of repeated hacks and information


And that’s simply because productivity and performance is simplicity, all the rest is distraction


But here’s 7 ways you can get more done that you might not have heard of before:
1. Take More Breaks


Whether you use a variation of the Pomodoro timer or take a 15 minute walk every 45 minutes
Taking more breaks is going to give your brain time to cool off and relax so that you can hit your next work block even harder.


It’s just like resting in between sets in the gym.
2. Learn Your Mind And Body


Look, we all know we aren’t the same


Different people perform better at different times and different people perform different types of tasks better at different times.
Learn your mind and body and realise when you perform what the best.


Are your creative juices flowing at 6am?


Or are your creative juices flowing at 2pm?


Learn for yourself and then implement.
3. Chew Gum


Now this might annoy your co-workers or basically anyone within 5 feet of you


But chewing gum has been shown to boost your cognitive ability, reaction time and fight off sleepiness.


So chew some gum, just don’t chew too loudly.
4. Stop Using To-Do Lists


Chances are, your to-do list has 10-20-30 tasks on it, am I right?


No wonder you end up frustrated and annoyed by the end of the day when you don’t complete it.


The solution?


 
Have 3 to 5 high priority, needle-moving tasks each day that you prioritize.


Not only will you make more progress than having 10+ useless tasks but you’ll also feel satisfied and fulfilled at the end of the day.
5. Use The “5 Minute Rule”


This is quite simply where you tell yourself “I only have to do ____ for 5 minutes and then I can stop if I want”
You see, the hardest part of any task is starting, so by giving yourself permission to stop almost as soon as you start you make this barrier a lot easier to jump over.


And I can almost guarantee you’ll not stop after the 5 minutes.
6. Use The “2 Minute Rule”


The name is similar to the “5 minute Rule” but the principle is rather different.
With the 2 minute rule, it is quite simply where any task that takes less than 2 minutes to do, you do it now,


Whether it’s making your bed, tidying your desk or sending that email


You have no excuse now.
7. Find Repeatable Shortcuts


If you do something ALL THE TIME, find a way to make it quicker and easier, whether you;


- automate with software
- delegate / outsource
or even something as simple as


- use keyboard shortcuts


There’s no point in making life harder than it needs to be, even on the granular scale.
If you want to win an argument, don't make these 5 mistakes:
Anecdotal (vs. Empirical Evidence)


Using a personal experience or an isolated example to try and prove a point instead of empirical or more compelling evidence.


Humans tend to believe and relate to stories, but don't fall into this trap.


What's true for you isn't always true.
Likely or Plausible Fallacy


Likely: Incorrectly assuming that just because something is possible means that it is likely.


Plausible: Incorrectly assuming that just because something is plausible means that it is true.
Begging The Question


Involves presenting a circular argument where the conclusion is included in the premise.


Examples:


1/ "Of course smoking causes cancer. The smoke from cigarettes is a carcinogen."


2/ "Circular reasoning is bad mostly because it's not very good."
Inverse Fallacy


Incorrectly assuming the probability of A happening given that B has happened to be about the same as the probability of B given A.


Example: Terrorists tend to have an engineering background; so, engineers have a tendency towards terrorism.


Nope, not the case.
Post Hoc Fallacy


Believing or starting that, "since event Y followed event X, event Y must have been caused by event X."


"The rooster crows immediately before sunrise; therefore the rooster causes the sun to rise."


Correlation does not equal causation.
That's a list of 5 common logical fallacies.
If you want to be insanely creative, you need to read this


- thread -
1. Understand the ‘300 Rule.’


Some years ago, I shared the idea that we shouldn’t expect any traction or engagement from our work until we’ve created and published at least 300 pieces.


Obviously, this isn’t a hard rule, and it applies differently to different kinds of content.
For clarity, we can apply this to, say, a thread or a youtube video (x 300 each).


It took me writing and sharing hundreds of articles before anything took off.
You will likely succeed far sooner, but don’t expect success or going viral before you’ve produced at mass.


Focus on the numbers.


Knowing this makes it easier to keep going when you might otherwise get disappointed.
2. Decide to be a maniac.


Don’t listen to the bozos who tell you to take it slow and ‘just enjoy life.’ No.


They want you smoking weed on the sofa with them, unproductive as all hell.
Creating things is our birthright and the most potent source of life energy when we allow it to flourish.


We are literally composed of the same creative force driving the expansion of the Universe.
Slow down if you’re burning out, yes, but do so to get on the fast track again.


Decide to be crazy creative, act like it, and your reality will bend to your wishes.
3. Grow a buzzing audience.


It becomes much easier to be driven to make and share stuff when fans are waiting for your next creation.


And yes, I know how hard this is when you’re not seeing initial results, and you continually share to crickets.
It takes time and a lot of work, but let this be part of your process.


Create for an audience and create to build an audience.


 




Befriend one person at a time. Be openly supportive of bigger accounts who may return the favour.
Aggressively take every inch of market share.


Stop waiting for them to come to you and be proactive. In ten years, you will regret that you coasted here.
4. Become a ‘creative athlete.’


You can’t create in a dark room all day and expect to maintain a relentless consistency.


You must feed and train your body properly in parallel to be creatively athletic.
Don’t eat trash and expect to be motivated. Develop an intimate sense for how your body responds and runs best.


This is the secret to those who appear to pull energy from nowhere day after day.


They train their bodies in service of their work.
5. Cut artificial dopamine.


You spend five hours a day on social media, youtube, porn, video games and movies, and then wonder why you’re unmotivated.
Short-term pleasure always comes with a price.


If you want to be insanely creative, you can’t allow your senses to be numbed by too much fake stimulation.
Artificial dopamine spiking means your receptors become less responsive to ‘normal’ stimuli like writing or making art.


Start replacing this passive stuff with creative action, and your body will reward you with a steady flow of positive feelings.
6. Understand ‘tempering.’


In sword-smithing, they use a process called ‘tempering’ to improve the hardness and elasticity of the steel by reheating and then cooling it.


A similar effect happens in your journey as a creator and audience-builder.
You must anticipate periods of contraction (cooling) and moments of rejection, or you will quit.


It’s all part of an overall strengthening and growth.
You could lose two followers as you gain five.


Your last piece might have been a hit, but the next one bombs. That’s good.


Just don’t quit, and you are guaranteed an upward trend of improvement and growth.
7. Track your output.


When we record our output somewhere visible, a funny thing happens: we fall into playing a game.


We try to beat our last score. We’re more aware of the dent we’re making.


Everything becomes more engaged and enjoyable.
First, make a commitment to consistent output.


Track your key metrics in an app or wall calendar. Record your creations and their results.


Newsletter subscribers, likes, and all.


Tracking the impact you’re making will push you to do more.
8. Have a mission bigger than you.


Your work takes on a whole new flavour when you approach it as a means to bring about an impact that goes beyond filling your bank account.
Even if it’s simply to inspire as many people as possible to create something themselves, this is all the purpose you need.


Go big.


Have eye-watering plans that inform a relentless commitment to producing cool shit.
9. Be results-oriented.


I come across so many who continue to do the same thing over and over, day after day, with little to no result.


They pat themselves on the back come nightfall saying they were ‘productive’ when they were merely ‘busy.’
You must focus on creating real results, or you will eventually hit a brick wall.


Identify what’s working, then do more of it. Take note, even of the smallest things.


Be aggressively biased towards results.


This will empower you to continue creating hard.
10. Focus on quantity AND quality.


It’s not either-or, my friend. You’re bigger than both.


You’re not a quality guy sharing one measly post every 10 days.


And you’re not a quantity guy, sharing trash you rushed out in five minutes a hundred times a day.
You sit at the intersection of both. Don’t allow scarce thinking to limit you to one or none.


It is in the mind.


You can do both.


You will find the time.


When you do, you’ll be surprised at what you’re capable of.

How to be insanely creative:


1. Know the '300 Rule'
2. Decide to be a maniac.
3. Grow a buzzing audience
4. Be a 'creative athlete'
5. Cut fake dopamine
6. Understand 'tempering'
7. Track output

10. Quantity + quality
Microsoft Excel is used by the majority of businesses but only 6% of people consider themselves an expert.


8 reasons you should become an expert at Excel:
1. Increases your income
Research shows it can increase your salary by 12.5%


I’ve personally used it to get raises and promotions, with raises up to 25%
2. It’s a marketable skill on the job market


Being an expert is extremely valuable and can be marketed on your resume.


But Excel projects can also become accomplishments, too.


Mine include:
• creating financial models
• tracking & management of a profit-sharing agreement.
3. Increases your efficiency


The ability to clean, sort, or organize data sets allows Excel experts to get projects done in a fraction of the time it would take to do manually.


This allows you to focus on data analysis and things that actually provide value.
4. Increases your quality of work


Because you can manipulate data, error checking is easy to build into a process.


This assures the data you’re sharing is more accurate than otherwise possible.
5. Create custom reports and dashboards


Using formulas and VBA (macros), you can use common datasets to create custom reports.


I’ve created custom reports such as:
• Cash flow analysis
• Tracked deadlines and due dates
• College football pick ‘em leaderboard
• and more


 
6. Allows you to process a lot of data


Excel has over 1 million rows and 16,000 columns.


Datasets that big are too much for someone to manage without a tool like Excel, but the program can handle them in a snap.
7. Makes data easier to read


Data can be overwhelming, so the ability to distill it and process it is huge.


Excel makes this easier with formula, filters, and the ability to sort and organize data.
8. Improve your decision-making


All that we’ve listed before:
• quality control
• custom reporting
• increased efficiency
• ability to process data
• making data easier to read


All lead to better decision-making.
It's a no-brainer that learning this powerful software can impact your career and work.


Soon I’ll be posting more tactical threads to help you learn Excel, so follow me so you don’t miss them.


Also, would appreciate a retweet of the first tweet:
5 mental concepts to make you more intelligent:
Chronological Snobbery


Believing the stuff of earlier times is inferior to that of the present, simply due to societal progress.


It's not enough to talk about “progress;” one must prove that it is so.


This requires a rigorous assessment of both the past and the present.
Chronological Snobbery
The Paradox of Abundance


The average quality of information is decreasing over time.


But the highest quality stuff gets better and better.


Abundance is simultaneously bad for the 'median' consumer but good for the 'conscious, discerning' consumer who filters out noise.
Sturgeon's Law


"Ninety percent of everything is crap."


Represents the belief that in general, the vast majority of the work that is produced in any given field is of low quality.


Therefore, we should take our time to find the very best content before we learn or consume.
Nirvana Fallacy


We reject something because it compares poorly to an ideal that in reality is unattainable.


We assume there is a perfect solution to every problem.


Reality is more complicated and trade-offs are abound.


Take the option with the most bearable trade-offs.
Goodhart's Law


“When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”


When we set a specific goal, people tend to optimize for it regardless of the secondary consequences.


An employee is rewarded by the # of cars sold.


They try to sell more cars, even at a loss.

The right way is the way you do it




This thread will make you better at Excel: 


Automatic Abbreviations:


If you're like me, autocorrect is more of an annoyance than a help.


Let's change that.


Set up your own custom list of abbreviations, and bend its powers to your will.


Type 'TBD'
Press 'Enter"
Output = 'To be determined' 
Consolidate:


Take data from multiple tabs.


Consolidate into one.


Sum, average, count, it's your choice.


By creating links to the source data, your consolidation tab will update automatically.


The best part? No formulas required. 
Camera Snapshot


Here's a little-known trick to move data between workbooks.


First, add "camera" to your quick access toolbar.


•Select your data 
 click 


•Paste to new workbook


The cool part: When you update the main workbook, the data in the picture updates as well! 
 
People Graph:


I'm a big fan of visual representations of data.


Using 'People Graph' is an easy way to liven up your spreadsheet, especially when tracking metrics related to, well, humans.


Create an infographic to visualize social media engagement, app users, customers, & more. 
Conditional Formatting:


As I said above, I'm a big fan of visualizing data.


Conditional formatting is one of the best (and easiest) ways to do this.


Let's face it, if your data looks good, you look good.


Spice it up by adding data bars, heat maps, or icon sets to show trends: 
Flash Fill:


Let's say you've got all the data you need––it just isn't in the right place.


"Flash Fill" is your friend.


Quickly extract pieces of text from one cell and move them to another OR combine text from multiple cells into a single place. 
Advanced Filter:


When working with large data sets, it's nice to be able to extract specific items and paste them to another location.


Advanced Filter lets you do just that.


• 'Data'
• 'Advanced'
Choose your range, filter criteria, & the where to paste the data.


Easy. 
Analyze Data:


I was never very good at Pivot tables, graphs, & analyzing data on my own.


Lucky for me (and you) Excel will do the heavy lifting for us.


•Select the range of data
•"Home" 
 "Analyze Data"


Charts, tables, & analysis––premade.


Click "insert" & you're done! 
Defined Cell Names:


Formulas in Excel are extremely useful.


That said, they can also be quite confusing.


By defining cell names, you can make them much more user-friendly and easier to read.


Instead of seeing = 'A3-B3'
You'll now see = 'Revenue-Cost'


Check it out: 


 
3D FORMULAS:


Let's say you want to add up the values in Column 'D' on 4 different sheets & show a single total.


Quit wasting time on SUM formulas that reference each sheet individually.


3D lets you select the 1st + last sheet in a series and dynamically include any in between.
10 things your parents never told you about work (but probably should have):
You Won't Love What You Do


Confucious lied.


He said: “Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.”


You set yourself up for failure if you buy it.


Pick jobs where you're competent and make a meaningful impact.


Then work every day of your life.
You're Replaceable


I've left many jobs where I held an incredibly important role.


Mark whatever has been completed and leave the remaining as open.


The separating line is the sticking point.


It sounds simple, but visualizing the sticking point is very helpful.
Deconstruct the Sticking Point


Generally speaking, what we identify as the sticking point on a project is really a macro output comprised of several micro inputs.


Deconstruct the sticking point into these micro-tasks.
For example, if the sticking point is a 1-page memo, the micro tasks might be:


• Memo title
• Executive summary
• Body structure
• Next steps


The sticking point should look must less intimidating when broken down into these small, individually-manageable tasks.
Create Separation


Feeling stuck is a combination of technical and psychological factors.


Identifying and deconstructing the sticking point addresses the technical, but you have to address the psychological as well.


Physical and mental separation from the work is key.


 
You can approach this separation in several different ways.
My ego is sad to report that none of those companies shut down after I walked out the door.


We're all replaceable.


Never let your status, accomplishments, or position go to your head.
A Different Job Won't Make You Happy


If you can't find a way to be happy in your current job, chances are the next one won't make you any happier (for long).


If you surrender your happiness to external circumstances,


You'll never find it.


Be happy where you are.
Great To Work With > Doing Great Work


My formula for career success is simple:


Do great work and be great to work with.


But if you have to choose one,


Intentionally find ways to be great to work with.


When push comes to shove, the jerks and trouble makers are first to go.
If You're Not Learning, You're The Problem


It's easy to sit and wait for others to take an interest in your development.


When they don't, you blame them for your stagnation.


But the truth is, your growth is your job.


If you're not learning and growing, do something about it.


 
Chess Players Win


As a leader, I'm often surprised by how much people suck at seeing the bigger picture.


The lowest level career skills are tactical.


It's the strategic thinkers - those who can see 2 or 3 moves ahead - who advance.


Play chess while others play checkers.
Things Work Out


My business ordered a material we didn't need and had to take delivery.


It was painful.


6 months later, supply chain issues threatened to shut down production.


That wrong material came to the rescue.


Big mistakes can become wins.


Relax.


Give it time.


 
Whatever You Make Isn't Enough


If you're only in your job for the money,


You're a bad employee.


Yes, you should be fairly compensated.


But if you're only showing up to get paid, what you get paid won't ever be enough.


If you can't find a better reason to show up, move on.
You'll Always Have A Boss


It doesn't matter what you do for a living, you'll always have a boss.


It may not be captured on an org chart,


But you can't escape having people you report to.


Whether it's a customer, a board, or a spouse, everybody's got a boss.


Get used to it.


 
Today's Excellence = Tomorrow's Expectation


Fair or unfair, your big accomplishment this year becomes the new baseline expectation for next year.


Will you use it as an excuse to hold back?


Or as motivation to keep pushing?


Nothing says more about who you are than your answer.
Thanks for investing your time in my thread.


If it helped you, I'd be grateful if you'd:




12 strategies to make you a more confident public speaker: 
Avoid Memorization


People memorize speeches to avoid screwing up. Ironically, memorization often has the opposite effect.


When you memorize, one tiny slip can throw you off.


You only know it one way, so you're unable to adapt.


It can make you appear distant to the audience. 


 
Instead of memorizing the speech, focus on a few key moments.


Perfect the opening line, transitions, and closing.


When you nail these, you create momentum—with the audience and yourself.


It instills a confidence you can build on.


Manufacture these small "wins" that compound. 
Study the Best


Identify 3-5 speakers you admire. Go on YouTube and find videos of each one delivering a speech.


Study them:
• Structure
• Cadence
• Movement and gestures
• Audience connection


By analyzing the best, we naturally move to embody the traits we've identified. 
Strike a Power Pose


A "power pose" is a stance that embodies a feeling of power—standing tall, arms spread and raised.


There is (contested) science that suggests it actually creates confidence.


Before your next speech, try it: stand tall, arms spread—feel that power.




 
As mentioned, the science around power poses is quite hotly contested.


Personally, I swear by it.


In my own experience, it has a real effect—even if it's psychosomatic.


At my first job, before every big presentation, I'd find an empty room and spread my arms wide.


It worked.




 
Practice, Practice, Practice


Find every opportunity to practice—both for a specific event and for the skill more broadly.


When practicing for a specific event, start by doing it in private to remove the fear.


Use your phone to record and watch your performance. 
More broadly, find alternative ways to hone your craft.


If you're at an event in a small group, use it as a chance to improve.


Join an improv class! I've had several friends do this—it sounds like a low-risk environment, plenty of fun, and a huge boost to your speaking skills. 
Find the Anxiety Killers


There are always a few people in the audience who are prone to smiling, nodding, and engaging positively.


At the beginning of your speech, find them.


If you ever start to feel the tinge of nerves, turn your gaze to them to get a jolt of confidence. 
Play the Lava Game


Kids play that game where parts of the floor are lava that you can't touch.


During a speech, I like to think of my pockets and torso as lava—I can't touch them.


This forces you to get your arms away from your body, gesture broadly, and embody confidence. 
Slow Down to 0.75x


When nervous, our natural tendency is to speed up—to get to the end faster.


Fight it: Think about trying to speak on 0.75x speed.


Pause and breathe—the best speakers have long, dramatic pauses. Use them as a chance to take a breath and gather yourself. 
Engage the Audience


You can dramatically reduce the tension in a room by creating action.


Ask a simple question, survey the audience, request they do something.


Find a way to get the audience active.


They'll feel more alert and you'll find a more welcoming environment. 


 
Storytelling Structure


The best public speakers don't deliver a speech—they tell a story. They take the audience on a journey.


Create a storytelling structure that is familiar and easy to follow.


It's often helpful to be clear and explicit about that structure upfront. 
Storytelling expert @nancyduarte coined the “what is vs. what could be” framework.


First, describe the reality (“what is”).


Next, describe the potential future (“what could be”).


This framework forces you to create contrasts to craft a captivating narrative for the audience.


Move With Purpose


Pacing around the room or stage like you're on the phone with your middle school crush isn't helpful.


Take slow, methodical steps.


There are people who move to move—and then there are people who move with intention, who are going places.


Be the latter. 
Never Self-Sabotage


When you're feeling nervous or uncertain, there's a tendency to self-sabotage.


We tell the audience we're nervous, we make fun of ourselves, we make ourselves small.


Don't do this.


It's ok to be vulnerable, but there's a line. 
Cut the Fear


We have a tendency to hype up our fears.


Always remember: the worst case scenario really isn't that bad.


Plus, the audience is generally rooting for you, too!


They place themselves in your shoes, so they want you to do well. They're on your side. 


 
"There are two types of speakers: those that are nervous and those that are liars." - Mark Twain


It's ok to be nervous—you're certainly not alone!


But it's time to fight back.


Give these strategies a shot—I guarantee they’ll make you a more effective, powerful public speaker.




Here’s 5 productivity secrets billionaires swear by:
1. Do what’s most important first


Who? Warren Buffett


Lesson:


How many times have you gotten to the end of the day just to realise you forgot to do your most important task?




 
Instead of putting it off and prioritising unimportant, busy work tasks, make your most important task your priority, do it first, and remove the excuses.
2. Have a schedule


Who? Elon Musk


Lesson:


Trying to decide what task to do next, when to eat, when to do this or do that is a complete waste of time and energy


Have your day planned and stick to it, you’ll notice the difference instantly.


Now, Elon plans his day in 5 minute chunks but you can plan yours in 1 hour chunks, in 1 minute blocks or in quarters, it’s really up to you.
3. Skip the middle man


Who? Elon Musk


Lesson:


Instead of information going from line manager → senior manager → director → VP etc




 
When and where possible skip as many in between people as you can, this will ensure the message that needs to be delivered gets delivered both accurately and quickly.
4. Go before you feel ready


Who? Jeff Bezos


Lesson:


Jeff says most decisions should be made with around 70% of the information you want to have.


If you’re waiting for any more, you’re wasting time.


In business and in life, speed is crucial, things change overnight and if you’re waiting to feel ready, you’re going to be waiting your whole life.


“As we wait for life, life passes” - Seneca

Picard management tip: Make it so that people feel they can come to you with any issue without fear of reprimand.
How to sell any service (without acting like a pushy salesperson):


A thread.
Developed in the '60s by David Sandler,


The Sandler Selling Method focuses on acting as a consultant,


rather than a pushy salesperson.


It shifts the focus from closing the sale to simply qualifying the lead.


Let's walk through how I use this on an actual sales call:
Step 1.) Build rapport


Before I get on a call––I look for a point of personal connection to the prospect.


• Find them on social media.


I go into every call with at least one unique point to relate on.


Instead of "how's the weather?" it's "Ah I grew up near X location too."
Step 2.) Establish roles


I start by giving the backstory on me as a founder & what services my business offers.


This does 2 things:


1.) it begins to form a bond (they know my story)
2.) it gives me credibility
Step 3.) The Pain


Next, I listen to what they need help with.


As they talk, I'm identifying which services of mine directly solve their problem.


I'm not forcing a solution onto them that "kinda" fixes it.


If I find I can't solve their problem––I tell them it's not a good fit.
Step 4.) Budget


Being a straight shooter is a superpower.


People will respect you for not wasting their time.


Straight up ask them what their budget is.


Transparency is a two way street so be prepared to share your ballpark pricing as well.


 
Step 5.) Fulfillment


Now that you know their problem & budget,


Propose your service as the solution to their problem.


Make it obvious you are only selling them what will solve their problem.


If they suspect otherwise, trust will deteriorate.
Step 6.) The Decision


Understand what YOU can do to make the decision a no-brainer.


Ask:


A. Who has the final say (the CEO, the board, etc)
B. What info can you provide to make the decision easy.
C. When do they want to make a decision by.


Help them help you.
Step 7.) Next Steps


Before leaving the call, present a concise timeline for what the next steps look like.


Send a follow up email delivering on your promised timeline.


This will allow you to:


• prove you're accountable.
• get the ball moving on the deal.








Being a new manager is scary.


You're suddenly responsible for leading a team and you have no idea how to do it.


I've served as a manager and executive at several companies.


Here's a step by step cheatsheet to help you become a better leader today:
1. Create the vision:


• Define what success looks like.
• Translate it into specific goals.
2. Communicate your vision to the org:


• Talk to all the relevant stakeholders.
• Persuade and help them understand how these goals will lead to success.
3. Create the strategy.


• Vision: our destination.
• Strategy: how we get there.
• Create a list of tasks and milestones that will ensure the team achieves its vision.
4. Hire the right people to execute the strategy:


• Identify what hard skills and cultural traits your team needs to execute the strategy.
• Interview and hire people who meet that criteria.
5. Train and coach new hires:


• First teach them how to do a task by doing it yourself.
• Then ask them to do it and identify gaps for improvement.
• Keep doing this till they can execute at an acceptable level.
6. Secure the necessary resources for your team to do their jobs:


• This includes everything from equipment and budgets to necessary tools.
7. Put a process in place to ensure high performance:


• Set measurable goals.
• Delegate work required to hit these goals.
• Monitor performance through weekly one on ones with every direct report.
• Identify what isn't going well and fix it.
8. Motivate your team and maintain morale:


• Set ambitious but achievable goals.
• Celebrate every win along the way.
• Make sure everyone is compensated and recognized for their work.
9. Build the culture:


• Culture: what we do and how we do it (values).
• Shape the culture by setting an example - embody team values in how you work.
• Celebrate others when they embody these values.
10. Anticipate what the future looks like:


• Always plan 3-6-12 months out.
• Problems avoided are better that problems solved.
• Identify future opportunities and make sure your team is ready to capitalize.
11. Develop your interpersonal skills:


Learn to:
• Listen.
• Communicate.
• Motivate.
• Give feedback.
• Take feedback.
12. Be self aware. Work on yourself:


• Good management starts with managing yourself.
• Be aware of your strengths and weaknesses.
• Work consistently on maximizing your strengths and limiting your weaknesses.
If you find it difficult to "focus", read this:
You're trying to concentrate, but your mind starts wandering and you're easily distracted


What happened to the laser-sharp focus you once enjoyed?


What's fogging up your focus?


Well, here are 10 Ways to Improve your Focus and Concentration skills:
1. Minimize multitasking


Attempting to perform multiple activities at the same time makes us feel productive


But it’s also a recipe for lower focus, poor concentration, and lower productivity.


Multitasking not only hampers our ability to focus but compromises our work quality.
2. Practice the Pomodoro method:


This is a time-blocking method that can help compartmentalize your tasks into manageable 25-minute intervals.


This method gives you the needed break in between work sessions to help you maintain focus longer and more sustainably.
Here’s how the Pomodoro method works:


• Set your timer for 25 minutes and get to work
• When the buzzer sounds, take a 5-minute break
• Then, set the timer again and get back to work
• Once you’ve done four rounds of this, you can take a longer break (20-30 minutes)
3. Get rid of distractions:


You need to eliminate distractions.


While you can’t do away with everything, you can make an effort to reduce or get rid of as many distractions as possible.


 
Start with the simple things like:


- turning off notifications on your phone or turning your phone off altogether


- telling those around you not to distract you for a period of time


- closing out of programs that aren’t essential on your computer
4. Establish a to-do list:


Having a written plan of action can increase productivity.


After you make your list, choose two or three key tasks and put them at the top


Then rank the rest in order of importance


This will help you prioritize what tasks you need to get done first.
5. Set a SMART goals:


If your lack of focus is a result of feeling overwhelmed by a complex workload,


Break it down into smaller parts and plug the smaller steps into the SMART formula.
SMART stands for:


• Specific. What exactly needs to be done?


• Measurable. How will you track your progress?


• Achievable. Can it be done by the deadline?


• Relevant. How does it fit with the overall plan or bigger goal?


• Timely. When does it need to be done?
6. Train your brain to focus


Your brain is a mental muscle, and if you are easily distracted you will definitely benefit from "brain training" exercises


Examples of such exercises include jigsaw puzzles, sudoku, chess, and brain-stimulating video games.
7. Exercise regularly


Regular exercise releases chemicals key for memory, concentration, and mental sharpness.


And, since the body and mind are so closely linked,


"when your body feels better so, too, will your mind."


 
8. Fuel your body


Fuel your body with foods that moderate blood sugar, maintain energy, and fuel the brain.


Try to balance lean protein, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats to stay fueled, and be sure to keep yourself hydrated with plenty of water.
Include a few of these “best brain foods” in your day:


• Green leafy vegetables like spinach, and broccoli
• Fatty fish such as salmon
• Berries like blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, or blackberries
• Walnuts.
9. Get enough sleep


One of the main symptoms of lack of sleep is poor concentration.


Getting a solid seven to eight hours ahead of a busy work day could be the difference between being frazzled and being laser-focused.
To boost your sleep, try to:


- Switch off all electronic devices an hour before bedtime. The light from these devices can stimulate your brain and prevent you from feeling sleepy.


- Take time to wind down. Read a book, take a warm bath, listen to soothing music.
10. Be more mindful


By being mindful and recognizing when your attention starts to drift, you can quickly bring your focus back to where it needs to be.


You can actually train your brain to be more mindful by practicing


- Breathing techniques
- Meditation, and
- Yoga.
If you want to become more focused


I'd encourage you to read 'Awakening'


This is a program based on the principles of PSYCHOLOGY and MEDITATION


It will help you gain:


- Clarity
- Confidence
- Discipline, and
- A laser-focused mind.


Try this:
When you're working on a project—big or small—it's inevitable that you'll find yourself stuck from time to time.


You’re staring at a half-completed page or screen—completely paralyzed.


We've all been there.


Here's my very simple framework for getting unstuck:
Identify the Sticking Point


Segment the project or workstream into its smaller component parts.




A few ideas:


Go for a 15-30 minute walk. Carry a pocket notebook and nothing else. Let your mind wander and jot down any ideas or insights.


Take a hot shower.


Go for a silent drive.


Read some fiction.
Unroll available on Thread Reader


The key is to be alone and avoid technology or connectedness for a short period.


Active solitude is a powerful unlock for creativity and non-linear thinking.


You'll come back to your work feeling mentally and physically refreshed—ready to take on the project with new energy.
Create Motion


Finally, once you get back to your workspace, dive into the project sticking point.


Move on the easiest micro tasks that you identified earlier.


The blankness of a sticking point is the most challenging part.


Remember: A body in motion tends to stay in motion.
Leverage your refreshed state to work in a short, high-intensity burst.


Think of it as 60 minutes—max.


You’ll be at your peak creativity after the forced separation, so take advantage of it.


Bias for motion conquers all obstacles.
Ok, that's my simple framework for getting unstuck.


(1) Identify the Sticking Point
(2) Deconstruct the Sticking Point
(3) Create Separation
(4) Create Motion


Give it a shot and let me know what you think.

Traditional learning models are dead.


Here’s a framework for a powerful way to learn:
I graduated thinking I hated most subjects.


What I actually hated was the learning model the education system forced upon me:


Linear, compartmentalized learning and rote memorization.


This thread shares my (work-in-progress) framework for a better way: Networked Learning.
Let's start with the traditional model—and why it's broken.


There are two core features to focus on:
• Compartmentalized
• Forced


A quick examination of each:
Compartmentalized


Traditional education creates containers in your mind.


I imagine them like little houses.


You have your history house, your English house, your science house, your math house, etc.


Each house is closed off to the rest of the world.
You have a history test on Monday, so you cram some new information about Genghis Khan into the designated history house.


Now it's trapped there.


You remember it for the test—people pat you on the back and say "great job!”—but by the following Monday, you've forgotten it.
Trapped knowledge is basically useless.


It's insulated from the interactions that allow it to stick and compound over time.


An analog: If you keep a child inside and forbid play with other kids in the neighborhood, it’d be very difficult for them to learn, develop, and grow.
Forced


Traditional education tells us to learn one thing—and be tested on it—before progressing to the next.


We progress on set timelines—established by others—from one subject to the next.


 




The model is forced, linear progression. There is no room for inspired consumption.
The obvious problem here:


Everyone learns differently—at a unique pace and with unique interests.


The current model embraces those who can fall into line and make it work while rejecting those who cannot.


It leaves too many people behind.
Ok so we've established a few core problems of the existing, traditional learning models.


I'd like to propose a better way—let's call it "Networked Learning" for now.


Let me preface this by saying my thinking is very much work-in-progress—open to feedback!


Here's how I see it:
The ultimate meta-goal of learning is for knowledge to compound over time.


We want to learn in such a way that new knowledge builds on top of existing foundations in an accelerating, non-linear manner.


For this to work, we need our knowledge to exist in an exposed environment.
Fortunately, this is the way we are wired—children do this naturally.


They are curious, experiencing every new event, person, or object with wonder.


They actively place each new learning into the context of existing knowledge.


They create and adjust their "maps" accordingly.
The key: there are a lot of "collisions" of knowledge in the child's brain.


There are no compartments forced upon them yet. There's no insulation of some knowledge from the rest of it.


Knowledge roams free in the child's brain—it interacts, reacts, and sparks growth.
This is the better way—a return to the natural manner in which we encounter the world.


We wrestle with ideas let cross-pollination happen. We abstract complexity in unique fashion.


 




Knowledge never sits in a closed, dark room—it sits in the light, ready to interact and compound.
This is great in theory—but how can you put it into practice (for yourself or your children)?


A few ideas I had to get started:
• Explore vs. Tour
• Analogize Constantly
• Paired Learning
• Read Broadly & Quit More
• Slow Down Learning


Notes on each...
Explore vs. Tour


When you're learning, always remember that you're an explorer, not a tourist.


Don't go on a tour of a new location, following the preset routes established by others.


Walk the streets, roam, talk to people.


You'll learn much more about the city that way.


 
Analogize Constantly


Always take newly-learned information and place it within the context of your existing maps.


Make direct or indirect comparisons and connections between the new and existing information.


It will help it stick and grow.
Here's an example of this in action:


I did a bunch of research on Morris Chang and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for a piece.


It struck me that TSMC's novel pure-play chip manufacturer model had enabled independent chip designers to start their own companies.
Unroll available on Thread Reader


I searched for an analog.


Then, it hit me: this looked very similar to what @tobi @harleyf and @Shopify had done in creating infrastructure that enabled independent players to sell online.


I had created context for the new learning within my broader mental map—it would stick.
Unroll available on Thread Reader


Paired Learning


Identify logical "learning pairs" that may accelerate the compounding of new knowledge.


Examples:
• Shakespeare + English History
• Sci-Fi + Tech Investing


If you consume simultaneously across logical pairs, you can engineer connections and compounding.
Read Broadly & Quit More


Reading beyond the confines of what is "useful" is one of the best decisions you can make.


I've learned more about investing from reading Sci-Fi than I have from most investing books.


Read more, but also quit more. If it doesn't grab you, drop it.
Slow Down Learning


Learning is definitively not a race.


The number of books read became a weird sort of vanity metric or "flex" for adults and children alike.


It's not impressive to read 52 books a year if you absorb nothing from them.


Slow down—let new ideas marinate.
There's a lot remaining to unpack.


I'm just starting to scratch the surface of my own thinking, but I'll keep working at it.


My hope is that this sparks a dialogue around new learning models and shines a light on the innovators who are building a better future for our children.
I hope you enjoyed this and found it interesting.

7 powerful tips from Reddit on being more productive each day:
Broken Windows:


The broken windows theory states that crime is the inevitable result of chaos and disorder.


Inversely, this same theory can be applied in terms of productivity.


The inevitable result of order and routine is accomplishment and progress.
reddit.com/r/productivity…
Procrastination = Fear


Why do we put things off?


Whether we recognize it or not, procrastination is typically a form of fear.


Fear of failure, fear of the unknown, fear of letting others down.


So we end up doing nothing.


8 steps to reclaim control:


reddit.com/r/productivity…
Fake it:


Schedule time each day to play the role of the person you want to be.


@JamesClear says "every action you take is a vote for the person you wish to become."


Trying to get more done?


What would a super-efficient person do?


Go do that.
reddit.com/r/productivity…
Multiple users:


The concept is simple.


Create two users on your computer:


• One for play & leisure


• One for work-related tasks only


On the "work only" profile remove any apps that aren't a necessity for focused work.


If it's distracting, it goes.
reddit.com/r/productivity…
Just one:


Everyone has days where they'd prefer to not do much of anything.


Next time it happens try telling yourself, "just one."


One more day, one more workout, one more step in the right direction.


Often that's all it takes.


One turns into many.
reddit.com/r/productivity…
Write it down:


An interesting post from a University professor on their process of using multiple hand-written notebooks to improve daily productivity.


I'm a huge fan of writing things down to ensure they get done, so this one resonated with me.
reddit.com/r/productivity…
It's not about doing everything:


Being more productive often gets confused with "doing it all."


These are not the same.


The most productive people single out a few items each day & singularly focus on moving them forward.


Simply put - narrow it down.

One last thing.


If you're into being more productive, try having fewer meetings.
If you struggle with motivation, open this:
Motivation depends on 2 things:


1. The effort required to do something.


2. The expected reward at the end of it.
High effort for low reward causes low motivation


But low effort for high reward inspires high motivation.


Keeping this knowledge in mind


Here are 7 things you can start doing today to double your motivation:
1. Eliminate distractions:


It takes 1 hour to build your focus.


It takes 1 notification to break it.


Avoid having to rebuild your focus repeatedly by muting your notifications.
2. Write it down:


Remembering things requires a lot of mental effort.


It also makes it hard to focus and prioritize.


Take 5 minutes at the start of the day to write down what needs to be done.


Less effort remembering frees up more effort for executing.
3. Do the hardest thing first:


Motivation decreases as the day goes on.


The day feels progressively harder if you leave hard things for later.


Get the hardest thing out of the way first.


Then reward yourself with easier tasks.


Your day will feel a lot easier.


 
4. Break big tasks into smaller tasks:


Big tasks can feel intimidating.


They also require a lot of motivation.


Make things easier by breaking big tasks into smaller tasks that require less effort and motivation to complete.

5. Understand the why:


Lack of motivation starts with lack of clarity.


It's hard to feel motivated when we don't understand why we're doing something.


Take some time to understand why you have to do a task.


This makes the task more meaningful.


It also makes it less boring.
6. Make it rewarding:


Ask yourself this:


Are any of the things you enjoy doing unrewarding?


Probably not.


What's unmotivating is often unrewarding.


Make your tasks more motivating by rewarding yourself at the end.
7. Sleep 8 hours every night:


Your brain can't focus if it's tired.


And your motivation suffers when you're having trouble focusing.


Sleep fuels focus and motivation.


Make sure you get plenty of it.

Every Sunday I use the 1 in 60 rule, it may help you change your life:
Every Sunday (so like 60% of Sundays) I have a little ritual where I check in to make sure I'm on the right path.


I use a framework called the 1 in 60 rule.
It means that for every 1 degree a plane veers off its course, it misses its target destination by 1 mile for every 60 miles you fly.


Further you go, further away from your goal you get.


I think this is true in life too.
So how do you make sure you're even on the right path?


You grab yourself a nice big glass of red.
You sit down to some music (I like instrumental).
You open your computer.
And you ask yourself some questions.


These are mine.
Am I happy doing what I am doing right now?


On a scale of 1-10 how happy and you can't use 7.
What would I do if no one was watching and success was inevitable in it?
What would I NOT do if I knew for sure it would fail?
What would I do EVEN if I knew it was going to fail.
What am I doing right now because I think I SHOULD do it?
Looking back at last week how much of my day was spent doing things I actively enjoyed?


How'd that compare to the week before?
Then throw all those answers and questions in Evernote and see how you progress.


It turns out it's a lot harder to get lost when you're constantly looking at the map.

Steve Jobs used this pricing strategy to sell 40 million iPads:


Price Anchoring.


What it is & how to use it: 




Our brains are responsible for thousands of decisions daily.


We can't possibly consider every angle of each choice we're faced with.


To combat indecision, the brain uses "heuristics" or mental short cuts based on previous experience.
Heuristics allow for highly accurate & instant decisioning.


But like any short cut, there is risk. Sometimes there are holes in the logic.


Holes that make us susceptible to irrational decisions -- like accepting a price without objection.
Price anchoring is a loophole caused by heuristics.


It's the psychological bias to overemphasize the first piece of information (or price) presented to us.


This strongly influences how we perceive additional information.


Companies use this to boost profits & sales.
In 2010, Jobs was unveiling the iPad in one of his legendary product launches.


While on stage passionately discussing scrolling experience & WiFi capabilities...


He was setting a price anchor.


The massive screen behind him displayed $999 (the assumed price of the iPad).


After a dramatic pause, Jobs had one more announcement.


Apple had "exceeded product cost" expectations and will price the iPad at...


$499


The crowd *literally* begins screaming & clapping -- safe to say everyone there (plus 40M others) bought an iPad.


Anchored to $999 as the only reference point for value, consumers see $499 as a great deal.


A rational mind would try to understand material & labor costs, or utility to determine value.


 
Psychology Of Negative Thinking And Tips To Tackle Them.


- Thread -
1. A State Of Permanent Emergency.


- Every time something happens, you assume it as a total emergency.


- It leads you to exaggerate the dangers and dismiss your resources to deal with problems.
2. The Self-saboteur.


- At the slightest difficulty, you take everything that happens as something personal and blame yourself for things over which you have no control.


- Your negative thoughts prevent you from thinking with logic.


- It causes you to become your worst enemy.
3. The Extremist.


- When something happens you can only see the extremes.


- You will find it difficult to find a good solution and feel a lot of anxiety since you assume that any decision is a path with no return.
4. The Tagger.


- You label whatever happens in negative terms because you can only see the dramatic consequences of the situation.


- It causes you to self label yourself ending up developing a very limited image of yourself and your potential.
5. Tunnel Vision.


- When you have a problem your vision is immediately reduced, like when you enter a tunnel.


- You see only the negative things, the problems, mistakes and shortcomings and miss to find solution.


 
6. The Generalizer.


- When you have a problem your mind wanders and begins to make free connections between the present and the events of the past.


- These connections lead you to make erroneous and negative generalizations and pull you into a cycle of negativity.
7. The Imposter.


- Because of your tendency to compare your self, you constantly magnify the positive aspects you notice in everyone else.


- You minimize your own strengths and talents.
8. The Superhero.


- You try hard not to disappoint anyone, you're proud doing everything, whatever the cost is.


- Your life is governed by the 'I must' and 'I should' to the point that you forget completely what you really want.
Tips To Tackle Negative Thinking:


- Develop Awareness.


- Notice the moments when you are actively choosing to revisit your pain.


- Learn from your past.


- Get curious about your mind intentions.


- Shift your focus from thinking about the problem to actually feeling it.
- Pull your mind out of negative thoughts and indulge it in positive thoughts


- Create new identity that's not pieced from your past.


- Talk to yourself in a positive way, it makes you feel much better.


- Think if you come across a similar situation before. Recall what worked.




6 ways great leaders think differently:
Under Authority → In Authority


It's a big moment when someone is given their first leadership role.


Because how you handle authority reveals who you are.


In my experience, there are 2 primary failures of authority 




Abdication and abuse.
Abdication happens when you're given authority and don't take it.


Abuse happens when authority is used for selfish gain.


Weak leaders abdicate or abuse.


Great leaders take charge when they're put in charge,


But think first about the good of those they've been trusted to lead.
Spotlight → Sunlight


I'm starting my annual Spring fight.


A battle to get grass growing in my yard.


I love trees, but trees are selfish.


They cast such a big shadow that they rob the surrounding grass of sunlight.


The tree thrives but everything around it dies.
The quality of a leader can be measured by what grows around them.


Marginal leaders crave the spotlight.


They thrive while others below them starve.


Great leaders intentionally prune back their branches to let the sunlight shine on those they lead.
Side Of The Table → Seat At The Table


My first executive role was on a ridiculously talented management team.


I felt like the dumbest one in the room.


For the life of me, I couldn't figure out why they let me in the room in the first place.


I sat quietly to the side.


 
It took a year to recognize it was fear - not humility - holding me back.


As a leader, there are others that could be occupying your seat at the table.


Smarter. More talented. Better.


But great leaders recognize they're the one in the seat,


And act like they belong there.
Status Quo → Status Quo Disrupter


When I took the role I'm in now, my job was to disrupt the status quo.


I changed processes, reorganized, added technology, and shook up the culture.


It worked.


The company grew in every category.


I firmly patted myself on the back.
Several years into the new reality I had built, I had a painful realization.


I was now the status quo.


Today's innovation becomes tomorrow's handcuff holding back the business.


If you let it.


Great leaders don't pat backs for long.


They get up each day,


And keep disrupting.
Comfortable → Challenged


For much of your career, you are being invested in by others.


Someone's job duties include seeing you grow and develop.


There are formal reviews, training programs, stretch assignments.


Then you become a leader,


And no one monitors your development.
I heard a speaker ask a powerful question:


How is your unwillingness to grow holding your organization back?


There's an overwhelming human drive towards what's comfortable.


Great leaders resist it.


They intentionally place themselves in uncomfortable contexts.
Actual Value → Perceived Value


As a leader, I struggle with the lack of tangible measures of success.


It's hard to point to what you did each day and say, "Today, I led well."


If you struggle with that too, I have good news for you.


It doesn't matter.
Leaders are measured by perception, not reality.


Which is why great leaders recognize the importance of small things like:


- How they interact with people
- Following through on commitments
- Clearly communicating
- Staying organized


They let little things create big value.

Everyone should have a Personal Board of Advisors.


Here’s how to build one (and use it): 
Over the weekend, I posted the thread below with a list of principles for career success.


The first principle: Build a Personal Board of Advisors.


I got a lot of responses asking for clarity on this idea.


This thread shares my framework for the Personal Board of Advisors…
Unroll available on Thread Reader
https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1507706403141693444
The general logic is simple.


If you treat your career lifecycle as a company...
• You start as a high-growth startup
• You grow into a bigger business
• You IPO and are a public company


At each phase, you're faced with a variety of difficult and new decisions and challenges. 
Traditionally, people have turned to "mentorship" to navigate the uncharted waters they encounter at each stage.


But "mentorship" feels very formal.


It carries a connotation of a fixed cadence and time commitment.


From the mentor's perspective, it feels like a big commitment. 
People are busy.


The person you want as a mentor is typically *very* busy.


As such, the conversion rate on asking someone to be a formal mentor tends to be quite low.


Furthermore, having one formal mentor often falls short from a utility standpoint. 
Your mentor may not have encountered the challenge you're facing—they may not have a "map" that you can leverage to navigate the terrain.


They may not be available when you need to make an important decision.


So let's turn to the concept of a Personal Board of Advisors... 
The concept is simple:


Companies have boards—ideally comprised of individuals from varying backgrounds and arenas.


The board isn't involved in the day-to-day, but provides advice on strategy, key decisions, and challenges.
